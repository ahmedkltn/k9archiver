Due to their imperfections, they were not useful for astronomic observation.</p><p style=\"border: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px;\">By the end of the 1500s and early 1600s, lens makers improved their abilities to cut and polish glasses.

When he reduced the amount of light and focused it, the images became clear but remained dim. No other telescope makers had done this, and Lipperhey’s telescope was the beginning of the telescope’s evolution.</p><p style=\"border: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px;\">In September of 1608, Lipperhey took his telescope to Prince Maurice of Nassau. A week later, Lipperhey applied to patent his new device. Other scientists and glass-makers came forward to claim that they had made similar devices; Lipperhey was denied his patent because of the claims.</p><p style=\"border: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px;\">The telescope spread across Europe after Lipperhey. By the end of May in 1609, the telescope could easily be found and purchased in large cities like Paris. Galileo picked up Lipperhey’s telescope and began to improve it. Galileo’s telescope was the first to be used for space observation.</p><p style=\"border: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px;\">Over time, astronomers began to build telescopes that had more power and clearer images. Thomas Harriot in England managed to build a telescope that could magnify objects six times. Galileo then made a telescope that could magnify objects by eight times.</p><h2 style=\"border: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.2em;\">What did the First Telescope Look Like?</h2><p style=\"border: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px;\">Early telescopes looked similar. The first telescopes consisted of long tubes with one or several cylindrical sections. The tube could be made of tin, lead, cardboard, and wood held together by copper, cloth, or leather ties and/or glue. Polished lenses and mirrors were placed inside the tubes to magnify images and reflect light.</p><p style=\"border: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-948 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://nineplanets.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/telescopes.jpg\" alt=\"Two telescopes on display\" width=\"486\" height=\"300\" style=\"height: auto; max-width: 100%; clear: both; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p><p style=\"border: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px; text-align: center;\">Credit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/esplora/cannocchiale/dswmedia/storia/estoria4_st.html\" style=\"border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; transition: color 0.1s ease-in-out 0s, background-color 0.1s ease-in-out 0s; color: rgb(9, 132, 227);\">Museo Galileo, Institute and Museum of the History of Science</a></p><h2 style=\"border: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.2em;\">What Were the Major Problems with Early Telescopes?</h2><p style=\"border: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px;\">Galileo’s telescope, along with others built during the 1600s, had serious problems. Early telescopes were exceptionally small in size and had a limited viewing range. It was nearly impossible to see objects further away.</p><p style=\"border: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px;\">Earlier telescopes did not have a fixed place for the eye, meaning the images that appeared in the telescope would move out of sight or out of focus. The smaller sizes also led to chromatic aberrations, meaning the telescope could not bring the colors of the object into focus or alignment.</p><h2 style=\"border: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.2em;\">Where did the Word Telescope Come From?</h2><p style=\"border: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px;\">The word ‘telescope’ comes from the Italian word telescopio, which appeared in the early 1600s. Telescope appeared in a letter from Frederico Cesi to Galileo in August 1611. Galileo’s letters show that he used the term after Cesi. The English form ‘telescope’ appeared in 1650. We still use this form in English today.</p><h2 style=\"border: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.2em;\">Did the Telescope Have a Major Impact on Science?</h2><p style=\"border: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px;\">Telescopes have given us significant insight into the workings of the universe, allowing science to progress further. Nicolaus Copernicus argued that the Sun was the center of the Solar System. With the use of the telescope, Galileo realized that the sun was truly at the center. Yet, the telescope did more than convince scientists that the sun was at the center of our Solar System.</p><p style=\"border: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px;\">The telescope has allowed us to observe planets and stars that are millions of miles away from our planet. They have allowed us to see the surface of the moon and the weather patterns of other planets. The telescope has also allowed us to look at nebulae or clouds of dust and gas in space.</p><p style=\"border: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px;\">The increasing power of the telescope gives us a clear understanding of patterns in planetary movements. In fact, Galileo first saw Jupiter’s moons and their movements through his telescope, registering these moons as satellites. They were the first objects in space recognized as orbiting another object.</p><p style=\"border: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px;\">Telescopes have allowed us to see into and study the depths of space, but they have also given us the opportunity to examine our own planet. Modern telescopes can detect heat waves, x-rays, and radio waves. Telescopes demonstrate how our planet interacts with others, and they can illustrate the properties of gravity and physics.</p><p style=\"border: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px;\">More recently, telescopes have allowed us to examine galaxies with planetary systems similar to our own. In fact, scientists are currently using telescopes to study planets with similar sizes and compositions to our own. We may be able to pinpoint planets in habitable zones, which are planets with conditions that could sustain life.</p><h2 style=\"border: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.2em;\">What Are Some Modern or Well-Known Telescopes?</h2><p style=\"border: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px;\">The Hubble Space Telescope is perhaps the most well-known of the modern telescopes. The Hubble is 13.2 meters long and has a 4.2-meter diameter. It launched in 1990, and it has completed more than 1.3 million observations since that launch. Its battery capacity is similar to the capacity of 22 car batteries added together.</p><p style=\"border: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px;\">NASA is currently constructing the James Webb Space Telescope, which should be launched in 2021. The Webb will primarily act as an infrared telescope. The mirror in the Webb is comprised of 18 different segments that fold and adjust. To protect it from the sun, the telescope has a shield with five layers, each the size of a tennis court</p><h2 style=\"border: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.2em;\">Celebrating the Telescope!</h2><p style=\"border: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px;\">In 2008, a conference was held at the European Space Agency/European Space Research and Technology Center (located in Noordwijk, Netherlands) to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Hans Lipperhey’s patent for his ‘telescope.’ Astronomers, historians, and the public were invited to the ESTEC conference center to discuss the history of telescopes, telescope technologies, politics surrounding the telescope, and the future of instrument technologies.</p><p style=\"border: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px;\">Part of the celebration included a visit to the Leiden Museum Boerhaave-National Museum of the History of Science and Medicine. Part of the reception included a dinner cruise that traveled from Katwijk to Leiden from the Rhine river to the Kagerplassen.</p><h2 style=\"border: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.2em;\">How Can I Learn More about the Telescope?</h2><p style=\"border: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px;\">There are several books that cover the history of astronomy. One is The History of the Telescope, written by Henry King and published by Dover Books. This book is a good start to learn about history, but the history in the book does end around 1950.</p><p style=\"border: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px;\">To supplement Dover’s book, Geoff Andersen gives a good account of the telescope in The Telescope: Its History, Technology, and Future (Princeton University Press, 2007). The organization of the book may seem confusing, but Andersen provides credible information. Andersen’s writing is also easy to read.</p><p style=\"border: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding: 0px;\">For those interested in using a telescope, Terence Dickinson and Adolf Schaller offer an easy guide in NightWatch: A Practical Guide to Viewing the Universe (Firefly Books, 2006). The book includes helpful inserts and diagrams to guide any telescope user.</p><h2 style=\"border: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; font-style: inherit; line-height: 1.2em;\"><br><br></h2></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>", "cluster": 1}}, {"model": "cluster.notemodel", "pk": 6, "fields": {"author": 1, "title": "Yuri Gagarin: The First Man in Space", "cover": "note_cover/yurigagrin.jpg", "is_verified": true, "is_verified_updated": false, "code": "YuriGagarin", "summary": "Yuri Gagarin will forever be remembered as the first person to journey into space.

Gagarin was further selected for an elite training group known as the 'Sochi Six', who would make up the the first cosmonauts of the Vostok programme.</p><p style=\"font-size: 1.6rem; margin-bottom: 2em; line-height: 2;\">Gagarin and the other prospective cosmonauts were subjected to experiments designed to test physical and psychological endurance; he also underwent training for the upcoming flight. Out of the 20 selected, the eventual choices for the first launch were Gagarin and Gherman Titov, because of their performance in training, as well as their physical characteristics — space was at a premium in the small Vostok cockpit and both men were rather short. Gagarin was 1.57 metres tall.</p><p style=\"font-size: 1.6rem; margin-bottom: 2em; line-height: 2;\">In August 1960, when Gagarin was one of 20 possible candidates, an air force doctor evaluated his personality as: \"Modest; embarrasses when his humour gets a little too racy; high degree of intellectual development evident; fantastic memory; distinguishes himself from his colleagues by his sharp and far-ranging sense of attention to his surroundings; a well-developed imagination; quick reactions; persevering, prepares himself painstakingly for his activities and training exercises, handles celestial mechanics and mathematical formulae with ease as well as excels in higher mathematics; does not feel constrained when he has to defend his point of view if he considers himself right; appears that he understands life better than a lot of his friends.\"</p></div><div class=\"article__block\" style=\"max-width: 80rem; margin: 0px auto; padding: 0px 2rem; color: rgb(0, 50, 71); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\"><figure class=\"article__image article__image--left\" style=\"margin: 1rem 5rem 2rem -10rem; float: left; width: 376px;\"><a href=\"https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2011/03/The_first_cosmonauts\" class=\"popup\" style=\"color: inherit;\"><img src=\"https://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2011/03/the_first_cosmonauts/10271214-2-eng-GB/The_first_cosmonauts_article.jpg\" alt=\"The first cosmonauts\" style=\"width: 376px;\"></a><figcaption class=\"image__caption\" style=\"font-size: 13.6px; color: rgb(129, 151, 166); margin-top: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5; position: relative; padding-left: 3.5rem;\"><a href=\"https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2011/03/The_first_cosmonauts\" style=\"color: inherit;\">The first cosmonauts</a></figcaption></figure><p style=\"font-size: 1.6rem; margin-bottom: 2em; line-height: 2;\">Gagarin was also a favoured candidate by his peers. When the 20 candidates were asked to anonymously vote for which other candidate they would like to see as the first to fly, all but three chose Gagarin.

My timer just went off!” in the middle of a conversation.</p><p style=\"text-rendering: optimizelegibility; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; margin-bottom: 20px;\">So I ended up just completely deactivating my timer during these meetings—whether they were 15 minutes or an hour—and picking back up with the technique when those appointments were finished.

Rather than cramming information into your brain all in one sitting, spaced repetition encourages learners to space out learning over periods of time. Under the Leitner System, learners dedicate different time periods to studying certain flashcards and concepts, based on the learner’s own needs or preferences.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; text-rendering: optimizelegibility; color: rgb(26, 29, 30); font-family: Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-weight: 700;\">How to Get Started</span></p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; text-rendering: optimizelegibility; color: rgb(26, 29, 30); font-family: Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif;\">To get started with the Leitner System, you need to do three things:</p><ul style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.25rem; margin-left: 1.25rem; padding: 0px; list-style-position: outside; line-height: 1.6; color: rgb(26, 29, 30); font-family: Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\"><li style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: inherit; list-style-type: disc;\">Create electronic or physical flashcards (one card per concept)</li><li style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: inherit; list-style-type: disc;\">Label three to five electronic or physical boxes with study time periods (e.g., Box 1 for cards to be reviewed every day; Box 2 for cards to be reviewed every other day, etc.)</li><li style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: inherit; list-style-type: disc;\">Add your study times to your calendar for organizational purposes</li></ul><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; text-rendering: optimizelegibility; color: rgb(26, 29, 30); font-family: Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-weight: 700;\">How it Works</span></p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; text-rendering: optimizelegibility; color: rgb(26, 29, 30); font-family: Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif;\">For the purpose of this example, we will use three study boxes labeled as follows:</p><ul style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.25rem; margin-left: 1.25rem; padding: 0px; list-style-position: outside; line-height: 1.6; color: rgb(26, 29, 30); font-family: Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\"><li style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: inherit; list-style-type: disc;\">Box 1: every day</li><li style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: inherit; list-style-type: disc;\">Box 2: every other day</li><li style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-size: inherit; list-style-type: disc;\">Box 3: once a week</li></ul><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; text-rendering: optimizelegibility; color: rgb(26, 29, 30); font-family: Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif;\">Every flashcard will start in Box 1. As you answer a flashcard correctly, move the card into Box 2. If you incorrectly answer a flashcard, place the card back in Box 1. Follow this method for each flashcard in Box 1. At the end of this round, you will notice that some concepts remain in Box 1—that means that these concepts are more difficult for you and require frequent studying. The cards that have graduated to Box 2, on the other hand, are concepts with which you are more familiar, so you do not have to study them as frequently.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; text-rendering: optimizelegibility; color: rgb(26, 29, 30); font-family: Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif;\">Each time you get a card correct, you move it to the next box. Each time you get a card wrong, you move it back to the previous box. Once you have finished studying for the day, you will see which concepts are ones that you need to study more frequently, and which concepts may only require you to study them once a week.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; text-rendering: optimizelegibility; color: rgb(26, 29, 30); font-family: Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif;\">Follow the same method on each study day until all of your cards have been moved to the last box. If it turns out that you have forgotten some concepts in Box 3 by the time that study day rolls around, move the cards to the previous box. Depending on how you have labeled your boxes and created your study calendar, you may only study one box of flashcards on certain days and multiple boxes on others.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; text-rendering: optimizelegibility; color: rgb(26, 29, 30); font-family: Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-weight: 700;\">Why it Works</span></p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; text-rendering: optimizelegibility; color: rgb(26, 29, 30); font-family: Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif;\">The Leitner System provides brain stimulation that cannot be achieved just by passively reading new or complex information. By actively answering questions and recalling information we have studied, the Leitner System helps us access the information stored deep within our memories over a longer period of time.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; text-rendering: optimizelegibility; color: rgb(26, 29, 30); font-family: Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif;\">When our brains are taking in a large amount of information at once, the rate at which we forget the information varies for each concept. Often, our brains cannot process all the information at once, making it more likely that we will forget a majority of the concepts.The Leitner System’s focus on spaced repetition and active recalling of information allows our brains to absorb the information and process it more effectively.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; text-rendering: optimizelegibility; color: rgb(26, 29, 30); font-family: Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif;\">For some people, altering a familiar study method may seem like an overwhelming task. But the Leitner System retains the familiar core principles of studying flashcards, while incorporating new elements that allow a higher level of efficiency. Whether you’re studying for an exam, teaching yourself a new language, or learning a new hobby, the Leitner System can help you achieve your learning goals.</p><p style=\"box-sizing: inherit;
